[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
Download the [Expo](https://expo.io/) application on your phone. In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

#### Start Backend

```bash

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Ives-Gomes/PlantManager.git

# Access the project folder cmd/terminal
$ cd PlantManager

# install the dependencies
$ yarn

# Run the server in development mode
# (you need the json-server-cli in your computer)
# Put your IP after --host
$ json-server ./src/services/server.json --host 111.222.3.4 --port 3003 --delay 1000

# Go to the nexts steps
